## Bump the plugin version when you change a plugin

When a PR modifies any file under `plugins/<name>/`, it MUST also bump
that plugin's `version` in `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
in the same PR. The version bump is a separate, deliberate edit. A
plugin change without a version bump is incomplete.
